Diabetes mellitus is the most common disease worldwide and keeps increasing everyday due to changing lifestyles, unhealthyfood habits and over weight problems.
In the proposed system, an efficient way of detecting diabetes is proposed through machine learning. 
Under machine learning, we used the classification algorithm LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SVC, XGBClassifier, Decision Tree.
The experiment results shows that the prediction of diabetes done at high accuracy.
